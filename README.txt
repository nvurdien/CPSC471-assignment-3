This program is written in Python 3.6

To execute the server you start the serv.py file in the servers's directory:
`` python3 serv.py <PORT>``
PORT can be any numerical value of an unused port

Then you execute the client you start the cli.py file in the client's directory:
`` python3 cli.py <HOST> <PORT>``
HOST must be 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' (also localhost)
PORT must be the same port as the server!

The extra credit is implemented and you can execute them by running the following server files:
forkingServ.py
threadingServ.py
with the following commands:
`` python3 forkingServ.py <PORT>``
`` python3 threadingServ.py <PORT>``
PORT can be any numerical value of an unused port

Nothing special :)
