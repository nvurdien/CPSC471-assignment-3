This program is written in Python 3.6

To execute the server you start the serv.py file in the servers's directory:
`` python3 serv.py ``

Then you execute the client you start the cli.py file in the client's directory:
`` python3 cli.py ``

The extra credit is implemented and you can execute them by running the following server files:
forkingServ.py
threadingServ.py
with the following commands:
`` python3 forkingServ.py ``
`` python3 threadingServ.py ``

Nothing special :)
